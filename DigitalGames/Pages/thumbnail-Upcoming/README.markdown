# Thumbnail Presentation with CSS Grid

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rrenula/pen/VMWMWx](https://codepen.io/rrenula/pen/VMWMWx).

This was fun to make. Again, it is inspired by Polygon's (polygon.com) bevel treatment on their thumbnails. I decided to take a step further and go crazy with it and at the same time playing with CSS Grid. This should work with older browsers as far as IE9. Older browsers and non-supporting browsers will get a 'conservative' design instead.
